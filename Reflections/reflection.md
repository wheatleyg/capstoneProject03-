This defitnetly wasn't written on Sunday.



---------------------------------
My biggest pains and difficulties during this project included
- I had very little CSharp expirenence starting out. I was constantly looking on StackOverflow and asking ChatGPT for help every 5 minuites because I missed something, and Rider's problem log usually looked like a christmas tree. 
- I probably couldn't tell you what half of my code even does now. I have a problem of not leaving comments, and my code was pretty badly written. But all that matters is that it works.
- I had basically 0 understanding of what API designed actually looked like, so most of the project was spent blindly making my models, repos, and so on, without any foresight of how many problems this would cause.
- Many more

Stuff I learned to do and NEVER will do again:
- Think out my proposal and project a lot more. A quarter of my time working was actually just spent revising the orignal plan and updating it to work.
- Always leave comments. Not too many, not too little. 1
- I rewrote code a LOT. It would've helped so much, looking back on it, to write some helper objects or whatever to simplify that.
- I would've structured my Services a lot more differently if I had the foresight of what I was doing.
- Ignore a lot of Riders suggestions. An example: myProperty can be made init only. I ended up doing that to most of my models, only to have to go back and change all of them all over again when I got to updating.



Overall thoughts:
- Painful project. I would've not spent days in class playing battlefield 6 if I knew how hard implementing controllers would've been.
- I wish I had more C# expirence. At least the 'next gen' of capstone students will.
- If given the choice, I'd rather be a frontend or game dev than to ever be a backend dev.
